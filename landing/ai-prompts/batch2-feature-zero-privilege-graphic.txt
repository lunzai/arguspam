PROMPT FOR: Zero Standing Privilege Feature Graphic (batch2-feature-zero-privilege-graphic.png)

Style: Clean, modern 3D illustration with playful elements
Aspect Ratio: 4:3 or square (1200x1200px)
Art Style: Friendly 3D isometric illustration with pastel colors

Main Concept:
Visual metaphor for temporary access and credential expiration - showing the lifecycle of time-bound database credentials.

Central Composition:
- Large hourglass or countdown timer as the focal point (center)
- 3D character figure on the left reaching toward/requesting access
- Database icon (cylinder) on the right with protective shield
- Flowing dotted line path connecting the three elements

Key Visual Elements:

1. User/Requester (Left):
- Single 3D cartoon character (simplified, rounded style)
- Character holding or pointing to a credential card/badge
- Badge/card has a small clock icon on it
- Character appears hopeful/professional

2. Timer/Lifecycle (Center):
- Large stylized hourglass OR circular timer
- Sand/particles flowing (if hourglass) in soft gradient colors
- OR circular progress indicator showing time countdown
- Glowing effect around the timer
- Small floating clock icons or time symbols around it

3. Database/Access (Right):
- 3D database cylinder in soft blue/teal color
- Shield overlaying or protecting the database
- Checkmark on shield indicating secure access
- Gentle glow or particles emanating from database

4. Access Flow Visualization:
- Dotted curved line from character → timer → database
- Small arrows along the path
- "1. Request" icon/badge near character (simple icon, no text)
- "2. Time-bound" icon/badge near timer
- "3. Auto-revoke" icon/badge near database
- Use color coding: blue (request), amber/orange (active), gray (expired)

Supporting Elements:
- Floating key icon that appears to be temporary/fading
- Crossed-out permanent credential card on ground (showing what NOT to use)
- Small expiration badge with X symbol
- Floating sparkles or particles suggesting automation
- Circular orbital lines showing the credential lifecycle

Color Palette:
- Primary: Soft blue (#6B9EF5), Teal (#4ECDC4)
- Timer/Active: Warm amber/gold (#FFD93D)
- Expired/Revoked: Soft gray (#C4C4C4)
- Accents: Mint green (#A8E6CE), Coral (#FF8B94)
- Background: Off-white cream (#FFFEF9)

Background:
- Very light gradient from cream to pale blue
- Subtle geometric shapes (circles, rounded squares) in background
- Faint grid pattern or dots for depth
- Minimal to keep focus on main elements

Depth & Dimension:
- Isometric perspective (30-degree angle)
- Soft shadows beneath all objects
- Layered composition (foreground, middle, background)
- Slight depth of field blur on background elements

Visual Metaphors:
- Temporary nature shown through fading/transparent effects
- Automation shown through sparkles, gears, or magic wand elements
- Security shown through shields and locks
- Time constraint shown through hourglass/timer/countdown

Lighting:
- Soft directional light from top-left
- Gentle rim lighting on character and database
- Glow effects on active elements (timer, shield)
- Matte surfaces with subtle highlights

Technical Specs:
- High resolution: 2400x2400px minimum
- PNG with transparency preferred
- Clean, anti-aliased edges
- Professional 3D render quality
- Balanced composition with clear focal point

Avoid:
- Any readable text or words
- Overly complex details
- Realistic textures
- Dark or aggressive imagery
- Cluttered composition
- Generic stock illustration look

Mood & Emotion:
- Efficient and automated
- Secure but friendly
- Time-conscious
- Professional yet approachable
- Clear and understandable
- Modern and innovative

Reference Style:
- Similar to Soleland, Asana, Slack marketing illustrations
- 3D isometric workflow diagrams
- Playful but professional
- Colorful but not childish
- Tech-forward design language
