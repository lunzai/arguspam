PROMPT FOR: AI Threat Detection Feature Image (feature-ai-detection.png)

Style: Modern 3D illustration with AI/cybersecurity theme
Aspect Ratio: 4:3 or square
Color Scheme: Blue (#3B82F6), Purple/Violet (#8B5CF6), Red (#EF4444), Green (#10B981), Dark backgrounds

Main Concept:
AI-powered security monitoring system analyzing database queries and detecting anomalies in real-time

Main Elements:
1. Center: Glowing AI brain or neural network visualization
2. Multiple database cylinders surrounding the AI core
3. Data streams flowing from databases to AI (represented by animated dots/particles)
4. Threat detection alerts appearing as notifications

Key Visual Components:
- AI neural network with glowing nodes and connections (purple/blue)
- Floating query snippets being analyzed (shown as code blocks)
- Risk scoring dashboard showing "Threat Level: LOW" with green indicator
- Alert notification showing "Anomaly Detected!" with red warning icon
- Pattern recognition visualization (graphs showing normal vs. abnormal behavior)
- Shield with AI chip/circuit pattern in center
- Small magnifying glass icon examining queries
- Real-time activity monitoring graph with waveforms
- Multiple user icons showing different access patterns

Threat Indicators:
- Red warning badge on suspicious query
- Green checkmarks on normal queries
- Yellow caution icon on moderate risk items
- Numerical risk scores (0-100)
- Timestamp indicators showing "real-time"

Composition:
- Central AI core with radiating connections
- Circular layout with databases around perimeter
- Floating notification cards in foreground
- Depth created through layering and glow effects
- Dark background to make glowing elements pop
- Isometric or slight 3D perspective

Visual Style:
- High-tech cybersecurity aesthetic
- Glowing neon accents (blue, purple, cyan)
- Particle effects and data streams
- Glass morphism on notification cards
- Professional yet futuristic
- Circuit board patterns as subtle background elements

Effects:
- Soft glow around AI core
- Motion blur on data streams
- Pulsing animation feel (static image but suggests movement)
- Depth through shadows and layering
- Gradient backgrounds (dark to darker)

Mood:
- Intelligent and sophisticated
- Proactive security monitoring
- Real-time protection
- AI-powered confidence
- Professional cybersecurity
