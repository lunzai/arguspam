Connection Elements:
- Flowing arrows/lines between layers
- Data packet icons moving along connections
- Glowing dots traveling along paths
- Bidirectional arrows where appropriate
- Color-coded data flows:
  * Blue: User requests
  * Green: Successful operations
  * Purple: AI analysis
  * Orange: Audit data

Visual Details for Component Boxes:
- 3D card/box appearance
- Rounded corners
- Soft drop shadows
- Subtle gradient backgrounds
- Icon centered or top-left
- Clean, minimal design
- Consistent sizing within each layer

Supporting Elements:
- Small gear icons showing processing
- Lock symbols for security layers
- Lightning bolts for fast operations
- Shield icons for protected data
- Circular badges with checkmarks
- Flowing particles along connection lines

Background:
- Clean white or very light gradient (#FFFFFF to #F8FAFC)
- Subtle grid pattern (very faint)
- Optional: Light geometric shapes in background
- Minimal to keep focus on architecture

Layer Labels:
- Small visual tags/badges indicating layer type
- Color-coded layer backgrounds (very subtle):
  * Layer 1: Light purple tint
  * Layer 2: Light blue tint
  * Layer 3: Light gray tint
  * Layer 4: Light green tint
- OR colored left border bar for each layer

Depth & Dimension:
- Isometric perspective (30-degree angle)
- Stacked layers with vertical spacing
- Shadow beneath each layer
- Components within layers slightly raised
- 3D box styling for all components

Color Palette:
- Component colors: Match actual tech logos where possible
- Accents: Blue (#6B9EF5), Purple (#8B7FFF), Green (#7FDBCA)
- Neutral: Grays for boxes (#F3F4F6, #E5E7EB)
- Connections: Gradient flows (blue to green, purple to orange)
- Background: White to light gray gradient

Data Flow Visualization:
- Animated-looking (but static) data packets
- Dots or small icons flowing along paths
- Different packet colors for different data types:
  * User requests (blue)
  * Credentials (amber)
  * Logs (teal)
  * AI analysis (purple)

Icon Styling:
- Consistent line weight
- Rounded, friendly style
- Not overly detailed
- Recognizable at small size
- Monochromatic or simple color per icon

Technical Elements:
- All components properly aligned
- Even spacing between elements
- Consistent shadows and lighting
- Professional diagram quality
- Clear visual hierarchy

Additional Details:
- Small status indicators (green dots for active)
- Version or tech badges (subtle)
- Performance indicators (speed lines)
- Security badges on protected components
- Redundancy/HA indicators for critical components

Side Elements (Optional):
- Character viewing/pointing to architecture
- Magnifying glass highlighting a specific layer
- Small annotation callouts (visual only, no text)

Lighting:
