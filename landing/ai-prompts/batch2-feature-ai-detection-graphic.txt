PROMPT FOR: AI Detection Feature Graphic (batch2-feature-ai-detection-graphic.png)

Style: Futuristic yet friendly 3D illustration with tech elements
Aspect Ratio: 4:3 or square (1200x1200px)
Art Style: Modern 3D illustration with glowing elements and soft colors

Main Concept:
AI-powered monitoring system analyzing database queries and detecting threats in real-time, visualized through friendly, approachable graphics.

Central Composition:
- Central AI "brain" or neural network node as focal point
- Multiple database cylinders arranged in a circle around the AI core
- 3D character monitoring the system on a screen/tablet
- Data streams flowing from databases to AI brain

Key Visual Elements:

1. AI Brain/Core (Center):
- Stylized 3D brain OR network of connected nodes (neural network)
- Glowing soft purple/blue gradient
- Pulsing animation feel (capture mid-pulse in static image)
- Geometric neural connections (lines between nodes)
- Surrounded by a soft circular glow/aura
- Small circuit pattern details on brain surface

2. Database Elements (Surrounding):
- 3-4 database cylinder icons in 3D
- Arranged in circular/arc pattern around AI brain
- Different colors: blue (normal), red (threat detected), green (secure)
- Varied sizes to show depth
- Gentle glow effects matching their status

3. Data Flow Visualization:
- Flowing particle streams from databases to AI brain
- Streams appear as glowing dots/particles moving along curved paths
- Color-coded streams:
  * Blue/teal: normal queries
  * Red/orange: suspicious activity
  * Green: verified safe
- Dotted or dashed lines showing connection paths

4. Character Element:
- Single 3D cartoon character in foreground (left or right side)
- Holding tablet or looking at floating transparent screen
- Character appears focused and professional
- Screen shows simplified dashboard with colorful indicators
- Character has calm, confident expression

5. Alert/Detection Indicators:
- Floating alert badge/notification near red database (shield with exclamation)
- Risk score indicator (circular gauge, no text, just visual meter)
- Checkmark badges near green/secure databases
- Small magnifying glass icon examining data stream
- Warning triangle in soft red/orange near threat

Supporting Elements:
- Floating UI cards showing "analysis in progress" (visual only, no text)
- Small shield icons with AI chip/circuit pattern
- Scattered sparkles or light particles suggesting active scanning
- Circular radar/scan wave emanating from AI brain
- Tiny floating binary patterns (0s and 1s in very subtle background)

Color Palette:
- AI Brain: Purple to blue gradient (#8B7FFF to #6B9EFF)
- Threat Alert: Soft red/coral (#FF6B6B, #FF8B94)
- Secure/Safe: Mint green (#7FDBCA, #A8E6CE)
- Normal: Soft blue/teal (#4ECDC4, #6B9EF5)
- Background: Dark navy to light gradient (#1A1F36 to #F8F9FE) OR keep light cream
- Accents: Lavender (#C4B5FD), Cyan (#67E8F9)

Background Options:

Option A (Light):
- Cream/off-white background (#FFFEF9)
- Subtle tech pattern (circuit lines, dots)
- Very faint grid
- Soft shadows

Option B (Dark accent):
- Light background with dark gradient panel behind AI brain
- Creates depth and makes glowing elements pop
- Semi-transparent dark overlay

Depth & Effects:
- Isometric or slight 3D perspective
- Layered composition (databases in back, AI middle, character front)
- Soft shadows beneath all 3D objects
- Glow effects on active elements (AI brain, alerts, data streams)
- Slight motion blur on data particles
- Depth of field (background slightly softer focus)

Tech Elements:
- Subtle circuit board patterns
- Hexagonal shapes in background
- Small floating code snippets (visual only, abstract symbols)
- Radar/sonar scan rings
- Network connection nodes

Lighting:
- Multiple light sources:
  * Glow from AI brain (purple/blue)
  * Ambient soft lighting from top
  * Rim lights on character and databases
- Dramatic but not dark
- Sci-fi feel but approachable

Visual Metaphors:
- AI intelligence: Brain/neural network
- Real-time monitoring: Flowing data particles
- Threat detection: Red alerts and warning indicators
- Protection: Shields and checkmarks
- Analysis: Magnifying glass, scanning waves

Technical Specs:
- High resolution: 2400x2400px minimum
- PNG with transparency
- Professional 3D render
- Balanced composition
- Clear focal hierarchy

Avoid:
- Readable text or code
- Overly technical/intimidating appearance
- Too dark or "hacker" aesthetic
- Cluttered with too many elements
- Generic AI stock imagery
- Aggressive or scary visuals

Mood & Emotion:
- Intelligent and sophisticated
- Protective and watchful
- Cutting-edge technology
- Trustworthy and reliable
- Proactive security
- Approachable not intimidating
- Professional confidence

Reference Style:
- Tech company AI illustrations (Salesforce, Microsoft AI marketing)
- Playful cybersecurity graphics
- Modern SaaS product illustrations
- 3D isometric tech diagrams with personality
- Blend of technical and friendly
