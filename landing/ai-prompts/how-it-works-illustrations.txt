GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ALL 4 ICONS:

Consistency Requirements:
- All same size (256x256px)
- All same perspective (isometric 3D)
- Same gradient color treatment
- Same shadow/lighting style
- Same level of detail
- Transparent or white background

Style Notes:
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic
- Simple enough to read at small sizes
- Professional SaaS product feel
- Not too literal - slightly abstract
- Use shadows for depth
- Avoid excessive detail

Color Distribution:
- Step 1: More blue (beginning)
- Step 2: Blue-purple (processing)
- Step 3: Blue-green (delivery)
- Step 4: Green with monitoring elements (completion/ongoing)

Technical:
- PNG format with transparency
- At least 256x256px (can be larger, will scale down)
- Crisp edges for web display
- Works on both light and dark backgrounds
