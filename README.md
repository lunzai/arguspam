# ArgusPAM
Argus Privilege Access Management (ArgusPAM) is an open-source web application for managing database credentials and access with a focus on security best practices. Because nobody likes a data breach! 🔐

## The Name
Our name comes from Argus Panoptes, the all-seeing giant from Greek mythology with a hundred eyes. Legend says he was so vigilant that only some of his eyes would sleep at a time - the others stayed wide open, watching everything. After his death, Hera honored his service by placing his eyes on the peacock's tail, preserving his watchful legacy.

Just like our mythical namesake, ArgusPAM keeps constant watch over your database access. While the original Argus eventually met his end when Hermes lulled all his eyes to sleep, our digital Argus never slumbers and remains vigilant against unauthorized access attempts. 🛡️

## Features
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Only get what you need, nothing more!
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The right permissions for the right people
- Just-In-Time Access (JIT): Temporary superpowers when you need them
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Because passwords alone are so 2010
- User Contextual Awareness: We know where you are (in a non-creepy way)
- AI-Assisted Security: Smart algorithms watching your back
- Audit Trail: We remember everything (like that elephant you dated in high school)

## Getting Started
Coming soon! We're working on it! 👷‍♀️👷
